# Expense Tracker App

A sleek and minimal expense tracker app built with Flutter. This app allows users to efficiently manage their expenses with features to add, edit, and delete entries. Expenses are visually displayed using a clean bar graph. The app uses ISAR for local storage, Provider for state management, and fl_charts for the bar graph visualization.
